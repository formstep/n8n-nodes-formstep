# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## Unreleased

formbase is now Formstep, and this package is `n8n-nodes-formstep`. It is a new package on npm, not a new version of `n8n-nodes-formbase`, which will be deprecated on npm in favor of this one. Earlier entries below describe releases of `n8n-nodes-formbase` under the new name.

- **Breaking:** the node, the trigger and the credential have new types: `n8n-nodes-formstep.formstep`, `n8n-nodes-formstep.formstepTrigger` and `formstepOAuth2Api`, in place of `n8n-nodes-formbase.formbase`, `n8n-nodes-formbase.formbaseTrigger` and `formbaseOAuth2Api`. n8n does not carry a workflow over to a new type, so an existing workflow needs the nodes added again: install `n8n-nodes-formstep`, create a **Formstep OAuth2 API** credential, put a **Formstep** or **Formstep Trigger** node in place of each old one, and publish the workflow again. The trigger registers its webhook under the path `formstep` instead of `formbase`.
- **Breaking:** Formstep signs and labels deliveries with `X-Formstep-Signature`, `X-Formstep-Event-Id` and `X-Formstep-Event-Type` instead of `X-formbase-Signature`, `X-formbase-Event-Id` and `X-formbase-Event-Type`, and no longer sends the old names. The trigger verifies `X-Formstep-Signature`. A workflow that reads the event ID or type from the headers, such as one behind a Wait node, reads the new names.
- The credential connects to `https://api.formstep.io/api/v1` instead of `https://api.formbase.so/api/v1`, and the documentation links in the credential and both nodes point at docs.formstep.io.
- The nodes and the credential are named **Formstep**, **Formstep Trigger** and **Formstep OAuth2 API**, with a capital F.
- The example workflows are `examples/formstep-request-wait.json` and `examples/formstep-submission.json`.

## 0.10.2 - 2026-09-28

Wording for n8n 2 and documentation links. Workflows keep working unchanged.

- The Formstep Trigger panel speaks n8n 2: **Execute step** instead of Listen for Test Event, and **Publish** instead of Activate. It also says that Execute step listens for two minutes, and that expired, canceled and abandoned events are checked on the published workflow.
- Documentation links in the credential and both nodes point at the n8n guides in the docs.

## 0.10.1 - 2026-09-27

Copy and defaults for n8n's community node verification. Workflows keep working unchanged.

- The credential's display name takes title case. The brand was spelled in lowercase then, but n8n's verification scanner requires title case and ignores lint exceptions. Existing credentials keep working: only the display name changed.
- Operation actions drop the article, as n8n's UX guidelines ask: **Create request**, **Get request**, **Cancel request**, **Remind request recipient**, **Replay request callback**.
- **Request** on Get, Remind, Cancel and Replay Callback opens on **From List** for a new node. A saved node keeps the mode it was saved with.
- Placeholders start with "e.g.", and descriptions and errors name a parameter in single quotes, such as 'Wait for the Outcome'.

## 0.10.0 - 2026-09-25

- **Formstep node version 2**, the default for new nodes. Workflows saved with version 1 keep their node and parameters unchanged.
  - **Fields** replaces the Prefill and Context lists on Create: pick a form and it lists every field a request can fill in, with its question and field key. A choice question is a dropdown of its options, a number, switch, date or time gets its own input, and context fields are marked. A date is sent as `2026-03-04` whatever the picker or expression produced. **Map Automatically** sends each key of the input item that is a field key of the form and leaves the rest out.
  - **Form** is searchable by name, or takes an ID. **Request** on Get, Remind, Cancel and Replay Callback takes an ID, as before, or lists the workspace's newest requests, labelled by recipient, status and External ID.
  - Create reads a form's field list once per execution, however many items it creates requests for.
- A retried Create with the same External ID and Documents gets the original request back instead of `CONFLICT`, although it uploads its files again: Formstep now counts a document by its bytes for idempotency. Needs a Formstep backend with that rule; the node itself is unchanged.
- Form pickers on both nodes mark a form that is not published yet with "(not published)".
- `examples/formstep-request-wait.json` uses version 2 and the Fields mapper.
- Internal: the node's parameters, operations and pickers move out of `Formstep.node.ts` into `actions/`, `FormFields.ts` and `FormstepMethods.ts`, operations dispatch from one table, and the trigger's event list drives its subtitle. `@n8n/node-cli` 0.49 and Vitest 5; `package-lock.json` is in sync again for `npm ci`, and the stale `pnpm-lock.yaml` is gone.

## 0.9.2 - 2026-09-25

- The README documents booking and payment answers. Since event `apiVersion` `2026-09-24`, a Schedule appointment answer in `data.answers` is an object (`status`, `start`, `end`, `timeZone`, `attendee`, `meetingUrl`, `provider`, `providerBookingId`, `eventTitle`) instead of a sentence, and a Payment question has an answer of its own (`status`, `amount`, `currency`, `amountRefunded`, `receiptUrl`, `paidAt`, `refundedAt`, `disputedAt`, `provider`, `providerPaymentIntentId`). `data.display` keeps one line of text for each. The node passes the event through unchanged, so a workflow reads `{{ $json.data.answers.<field_key>.start }}` without a node change; one that read the booking as text reads `data.display.<field_key>` instead.

## 0.9.1 - 2026-09-24

- The README lists `data.submission.updatedAt` and `data.submission.editCount`, which submission and request events now carry: when the submission was last edited (`null` until the first edit) and how many times (`0` on a fresh submission). They reach a workflow without a node change, since the node passes the event through unchanged.
- An error thrown by one of n8n's own helpers, such as a failed document upload, keeps its HTTP status code. The node recognized n8n errors with `instanceof`, which fails for errors built by n8n's copy of n8n-workflow, so it wrapped them in a new error without the code. It now recognizes them by their shape and rethrows them unchanged. Deactivating a trigger whose subscription Formstep already deleted uses the same check. (#2)

## 0.9.0 - 2026-09-24

- **Documents** on **Create**: attach files from the input item's binary fields to the request. The node reserves each file with `documents.create`, uploads it to the presigned URL, and passes the documents to `requests.create`, which checks their size and sha256. A form with several Documents blocks takes the target block from a picker.
- Errors show the Formstep code and message, such as `CONFLICT: Idempotency key "run-42" was already used for a different request...`, instead of n8n's generic "Bad request - please check your parameters". The description lists the reason, the parameter and the valid keys when Formstep gives them. Before, only an error returned with HTTP 200 was unwrapped; every error from the Formstep API now is.
- The README documents errors, Remind on requests without email delivery, the millisecond timestamps of Get and Get Many, and the `decision` field key behind `outcome`.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-09-23

0.7.0 was never published to npm. 0.8.0 is the first release carrying its changes and the new updated-submission event.

- **Behaviour change:** a workflow on **Public Link Submission Created** no longer runs when a respondent edits a submission they already sent. It now receives `submission.completed` only. To act on edits, add a trigger node on the new **Public Link Submission Updated** event, which subscribes to `submission_updated` and receives `submission.updated`. The form must allow editing after submit. Requests never produce an update event. Needs a Formstep backend that accepts the `submission_updated` subscription event (Formstep issue #229).
- The submission events are named **Public Link Submission Created**, **Public Link Submission Updated** and **Public Link Submission Abandoned** and cover public-link submissions only. A completed request runs **Request Completed** alone and no longer runs a submission trigger on the same form (Formstep ADR 0030, one channel, one event), so a workflow with both triggers runs once per completion, and a submission event never carries `data.request`. A workflow that wants every answer, whichever channel produced it, uses one trigger node on each event.
- Shorter event descriptions.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-09-23

- Add the **Formstep** node with the Request resource: **Create** a request for a form and a recipient with prefilled, read-only and context fields, reminders, expiry, language, metadata, test mode and email delivery; **Get**, **Get Many** (cursor paging across a form or the workspace, with status, outcome, external ID and test filters), **Cancel** with a reason, **Remind**, and **Replay Callback**. Form and field-key pickers load from the credential's workspace. The node is usable as an AI agent tool.
- **Wait for the Outcome** on Create points the request's callback at `{{ $execution.resumeUrl }}`, so a Wait node set to *On Webhook Call* pauses the workflow until the request is completed, expires or is canceled, and resumes it with the event envelope under `$json.body`. Setting a Callback URL of your own at the same time is refused.
- Create sends **External ID** as the request's `idempotencyKey`, so a retried execution gets the same request back instead of creating a second one.
- The trigger offers **Request Completed**, **Request Expired** and **Request Canceled** events next to the submission events, registered and verified the same way. A completed request also runs a Submission Created trigger on the same form.
- Add `examples/formstep-request-wait.json`, the create-wait-branch pattern end to end.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-09-23

- Describe the node in terms of requests: it resumes workflows when a customer completes a request or submits a form.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-09-22

- Read the Formstep event envelope (`id`, `type`, `createdAt`, `apiVersion`, `test`, `data`) that replaced the flat payload. `fields[]` is gone: every answer arrives once in `data.answers` keyed by field key, with the readable text in `data.display`. Event types are `submission.completed`, `submission.updated` and `submission.abandoned`; the PDF link is `data.submission.pdfUrl`.
- Pass the envelope to the workflow unchanged instead of flattening answers into the item. A field key can therefore never collide with `id`, `type` or `test`, and `{{ $json.data.answers.<field_key> }}` reads the same path the Formstep contract documents.
- Carry `data.request` through for a submission that answered a request, and `test` for a test delivery.
- The example workflow maps the new paths.
- Register exactly one subscription per node: activation keeps the subscription it registered last and removes any other n8n subscription for the same webhook URL and event, so a second, unverifiable delivery path never stays open.
- List forms from the workspace the credential is scoped to, across every `forms.list` page, instead of fanning out over workspaces.
- Offer the default event first and idle windows shortest first.
